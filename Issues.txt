Issues:
    - Instead of redirect output to a file make terminal process wait for a keypress before exit (when something is shows up on the stderr)??
    - Make appcoins products' skuid uniques.
    - Make appcoins unity prefab be able to change its name.
    - Serializable scripts to store some information like paths when unity is shuted down.
